# **Tweets Reporting Abuse Classification Task** 

Understanding reportings and confessions of abuse in online space is an import task, as most of the victims of abuse and violence donâ€™t generally report it to concerned body. Currently there are no annotated datasets are available for this task.

* We release the first medium scale manually annotated corpus for abuse classification problem
* Propose a shared task for this problem **TRACT**

## Task
This new, multi-class classification task involves distinguishing three classes of tweets that mention abuse reportings: "report" (annotated as 1);  "empathy" (annotated as 2);  and   "general" (annotated as 3) 

### Important dates
* Registration deadline :  
* Result submission :
